# Contributing to DJ With Friends
Thinking about contributing? Contributions are more than welcome. There are only a few steps that need to be taken in order to submit a PR. 

If you're looking for something to tackle, try browsing our [current issues](https://github.com/TylerJDev/DJ-With-Friends/issues). You can also take a look at our current [roadmap](https://github.com/TylerJDev/DJ-With-Friends/projects) to see what we're planning on adding in the future.

Here's how the process should look when you're making a PR for an existing issue.

* Find an issue & get assigned it
* Fork the repository and create a new branch
* Commit changes for that branch
* Add tests if required
* Ensure all tests are green
* Submit a PR against the `dev` branch

The `dev` branch always contains the latest changes. Our current GitHub Actions workflow has checks against `dev`, and this is where any new feature will wait until it's ready to be merged against `master`.
